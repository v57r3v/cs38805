INTRODUCTION 
Most organic compounds contain at least one   other   element   apart   from   carbon   and hydrogen.   These elements are usually non-metals, the common ones being halogens, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur   and phosphorus. The hydrocarbon part of   these organic molecules is relatively inert and the   other   elements form   the   centre   of   interest   for   chemical   reactions. The   hydrocarbon   part   of   the   molecule   is   called   a radical and can be represented by the symbol R-. It is essentially the hydrocarbon part of   the molecule with   one   of   the   hydrogen   atoms   removed. The   reactive   portion   of   the   molecule   is   termed   the functional group. 
Many biological molecules have large, relatively inert, carbon skeletons, often containing   complicated   ring systems. The reactive sites in these molecules usually contain a   variety   of   functional   groups which   influence   the   reactivity   of   the   molecules   in   biological   systems. This   can   be   seen   in   the structures   of   the   molecules   of   some   familiar   compounds   given   below. The   first   three   molecules   have similar   carbon   frameworks   - they   belong   to   a   class   of   compounds   known   as   steroids.   However, the first is the male hormone testosterone, the second the female hormone progesterone and the third is         norethynodrel, which has been used in contraceptive pills.
Some other interesting molecules include:

NOTE: that there seems to be a lot of 'memory' work in organic chemistry. However, the most important skills are being able to identify and use the patterns in structure and reactivity and the rules for naming organic molecules and for writing structures (isomers), including being able to determine the reactivity of a molecule from its functional groups. The classification of organic reactions on page 7.13 will be used throughout this module.
FUNCTIONAL GROUPS 
A functional group is an atom or a   specific   group   of   atoms   in   an   organic molecule   that   is   responsible   for the reactivity of   the molecule. For example, in alkenes, the functional group   is the   double bond, in alkynes it is the triple bond. All the other functional groups contain   atoms   other than   carbon   such   as O,   S, N and halogens.

Note: R, R′ and R′′ are used to show that there can be   different hydrocarbon   chains   in   the molecule
Exercise 8.1 
Identify the functional groups in the following molecules. Note that in these diagrams the carbon skeleton has been reduced to a line form like that used for cycloalkanes. 

HALOALKANES 
Haloalkanes are fluoride, chloride, bromide or iodide substituted hydrocarbons.   The   symbol X   is   often   used   to   represent   the   halide, so   that   R⎯X   is   a   general   formula   for   an   organic   halide.    Haloalkanes  代 写CHEM 191 MODULE 8 ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 2Java
代做程序编程语言 are    made by substituting alkanes with the halogens or, more easily, by the   addition   of   HX to the   double bond in an   alkene:

These molecules have found many uses in the past but the environmental impact of their use has been such that, in many cases, they are now being phased out. Freons (CFCs) e.g. CCl2F2, were once widely used as refrigerants, but the escape of these molecules into the atmosphere is a contributor to the partial destruction of the ozone layer in the stratosphere which, in turn, results in more ultraviolet light reaching the surface of the earth. 

The haloalkane molecule commonly known as DDT has the systematic name 1,1-di(4-chlorophenyl)-2,2,2-trichoroethane. 

DDT was widely and very successfully used as an insecticide from the 1940s to the 1960s and saved millions of human lives from death via malaria. However, it was not easily decomposed in the environment and found its way into the food chain of higher animals. One of its effects was to cause the thinning of the shells of birds’ eggs and so its use has been banned.
Naming Haloalkanes Haloalkanes are named the same way as alkanes with the halogen included   as   a prefix   similar to   the   branched   chains. The   position   of   the   halogen   must   be   indicated   (unless   its   position   is   unambiguous)   When there is more than one halogen present they are listed alphabetically.
Examples:
Reactions of Haloalkanes: 
Substitution: It is possible to replace the halogen atom with either an –OH or   an –NH2    functional   group   given   the   right   conditions. These   are   examples   of substitution reactions.
Note: When writing the equations for organic reactions it is sometimes   more   convenient   to write   only   the structures of   the reactants and products with the reaction conditions written over the   arrow.
Examples: 1. Substitution with -OH using KOH(aq): When   an   aqueous   solution   of   potassium   hydroxide,   KOH(aq), is reacted with haloalkanes the halogen is swapped for –OH and   an   alcohol is   formed.
For example: chloroethane reacts with KOH(aq) to form. ethanol
The equation written below uses the expanded structure and so makes the   change   occurring more obvious.

2. Substitution with -NH2 using NH3(alc): When   aconcentrated   solution   of   ammonia   in
ethanol, NH3(alc), is added to a haloalkane (under high pressure) the halogen atom is replaced by   the    -NH2    group and an   amine   is   formed.
For example: chloroethane   reacts   with   NH3(alc) to   form   ethanamine.

Elimination: Under the right reaction conditions it is possible to remove the halogen atom and the   hydrogen atom from a carbon atom   adjacent to that to which the   halogen   is   attached.   This   results   in the   formation   of   a   double   bond. The   reagent   used   is   a   concentrated   solution   of   potassium   hydroxide   in alcohol (ethanol), KOH(alc).   Since atoms are removed and not replaced this is   an example   of   an elimination reaction.
